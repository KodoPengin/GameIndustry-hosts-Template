# Attention! Some programs can cause trouble:
Since I specify connections per product and thus also duplicate entries and strict block "critical" processes (e.g. Windows Spyware, some activation services), it's difficult sometimes. Manufacturers do not like this approach, take the initiative and the hosts will be deleted from your system or will be strongly modified without a hint.<br>
- Kaspsersky Internet Security requires an exception rule
- Microsoft Windows Defender requires an exception rule
- IoBIT Driver Booster deletes mostly every AWS entry
- WiseCare also modify the hosts
- Malwarebytes makes false statements when certain entries are in the file and changes the hosts as well

If you use any of these programs, you should look carefully which rights they take, which and why error messages are displayed and which files they can modified.

Safety does not automatically mean safety in the way we as end users imagine it. Especially since manufacturers and publisher who promise us security often work to their own advantage.

# Installation for Windows and other systems:
Windows: %SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts<br>
Linux: /etc/hosts<br>
Android: /etc/hosts (a symbolic link to /system/etc/hosts) 

# Hints:
Careful with using entries. Some may be strict and many services may not work

# Bugs, Mistakes, questions:
Even me is not perfect and there may be wrong entries or spelling mistakes. If so, do not hesitate to contact me ASAP - Please open a ticket, contact me in Steam or about my website. Corrections (if needed) are quickly implemented.

# Copyright, Support & License
It's a single project. Creating and maintaining the list has taken several years a lot of money and have build alone from scratch.<br><br>
